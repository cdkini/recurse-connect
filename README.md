Recurse Connect is a social networking platform designed for and by the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) community. Using the Recurse API, Recurse Connect creates weighted network graphs connecting participants based on time spent at RC. Users can query for likeminded participants using a variety of factors and visualize various pathfinding algorithms, including DFS, BFS, Dijsktra's, and A*, to determine the necessary people to talk to in order to make a new connection!

Recurse Connect is primarily written in Go on the backend with React and TypeScript making up the frontend. The application is hosted on Google Cloud App Engine.
